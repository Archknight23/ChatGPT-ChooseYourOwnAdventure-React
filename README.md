# Creating a Web-based Choose Your Own Adventure MMO project
Much of this code was created by ChatGPT, with refinement and variables added by us, as well as some tailwindscss choices where necessary.

## What's cool about it? 
Besides that it was made with AI at the helm, it uses a MongoDB Atlas Cluster to store users' character info and login information as well as "scene" and NPC Data. The MVP would be to have a system where Admins/DMs could create Text Based Adventures and upload them for a User to be able to browse and start different experiences via text. Possibly create their own, and long term goals are to have a market system, a settlement/faction system, and online elements. 


> It's also powered by Chaos herself, and the development of this program may be streamed.

[This is still heavily in development and is almost guaranteed to be full of profanity and other nonsense.]

## "How Frequently will you two commit stuff?" 

"Hehehe, as randomly and chaotically as Darling and me's schedule can allow. <3" - Yuki, 2022
Yes...our schedules are in complete flux lately, but we'll do our best. Please feel free to fork and even develop scenes for this program as we go along. 
Make sure to credit ChatGPT and its source, as well as us though.
